# Docker-Nginx-WebApp

This repository contains instructions for **Setting Up a Dockerized Nginx Web Application**.

---

## Description

Dockerizing an Nginx web application involves creating a `Dockerfile` that specifies the environment and dependencies required to run the application. The `Dockerfile` starts with the official Nginx runtime as the base image, sets the working directory, copies the application code to the container, exposes port 80, and runs the Nginx application.

---

## Prerequisites

- Install Docker.
- Install Git.

## Workflow: Usage

### :information_source: Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repo_url>
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
   Navigate to the root directory of the application and run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker build -t my-nginx-app .
    ```

   This command creates a Docker image named `my-nginx-app` containing the application code and dependencies.

3. **Run the application:**
   Start the application in a container using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -p 80:80 my-nginx-app
    ```

   This command starts a container and maps port 80 on the host to port 80 in the container, making the application available at [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80).

### Notes

This example demonstrates the basics of Dockerizing an Nginx web application. For production-grade deployments, consider adding:

- Health checks.
- Logging and monitoring.
- Security enhancements.
- Integration with databases, caching, and load balancing.
